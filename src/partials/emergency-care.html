  <h4>What to Do in Case of a Problem with your Braces</h4>
  <p>Call our office as soon as possible during regular business hours if you break or loosen any of your<br>
  appliances. Please do not come directly to the office â€“ by calling us, you will allow us to create a time to<br>
  see you. Even if you have a regular appointment scheduled, call us immediately to notify us if you need<br>
  an appliance repaired.</p>
  
  <h4>Loose Brackets or Bands</h4>
  <p>Call our office during regular business hours for advice if a bracket or wire is loosened. The bracket may<br>
  need to be re-fitted as soon as possible. If you need to cut a wire in while at home, you may use clean<br>
  craft clippers or fingernail clippers. Please call our office the next day during regular business hours so<br>
  that we may schedule an appointment for you.</p>
  
  <h4>Wire Irritations</h4>
  <p>Sometimes discomfort caused by a wire on your braces can be resolved by moving the wire away from<br>
  the irritated area with a cotton swab or clean pencil eraser. If the wire will not move, try covering the<br>
  end of it with a small piece of cotton or a small amount of wax. Sometimes you will need to dry the area<br>
  before with a cotton swab before you apply the wax so the wax will stick. If the wire is painful, you can<br>
  cut it with nail clippers or scissors that have been washed. If you cannot resolve the wire irritation, call<br>
  our office during regular business hours for an appointment.</p>
  
  <h4>Lost Separators</h4>
  <p>Most patients lose a separator during their treatment. Do not worry about losing a separator, but call<br>
  our office during regular business hours to see if it needs to be replaced.</p>
  
  <h4>Discomfort with Orthodontic Treatment</h4>
  <p>During the first week after your braces are in place and routine adjustments are complete, you will likely<br>
  feel some soreness or discomfort. While adjusting to your new braces, you may take the same pain<br>
  reliever that your family doctor recommends for a headache. A warm wash cloth or heating pad may<br>
  reduce the soreness in your jaws.</p>
  
  <h4>Accident involving a chipped, or knocked out tooth</h4>
  <p>Most accidents involving a slight chip to a tooth is best handled initially by your general dentist.<br>
  However if you are in active orthodontic treatment and experience severe trauma to the teeth resulting<br>
  in tooth mobility, please call our office immediately. If it is not during business hours please leave a<br>
  message on the emergency line and your call will be returned by Dr. Periago.</p>
