    <p>Welcome to Periago Orthodontics! We are so excited to have the pleasure of providing you with excellent orthodontic care in a warm, friendly and professional environment. Each of our locations offers convenient office hours to accommodate your hectic schedule.</p>
    <p>Our greatest goal is to give you the healthy, straight, beautiful smile that you’ve always wanted. We understand that choosing to receive orthodontic care is a big decision, and we would love to earn the privilege of treating you or your family. Our practice will work with you every step of the way to make sure that your orthodontic care is as rewarding as possible. Our practice utilizes the latest technology, offering a variety of safe and gentle treatment options to give you the customized, individual care you deserve.</p>

    <h4>Every Smile starts with a complimentary Initial Consultation</h4>
    <p>Your first visit to our office is complimentary and is designed to provide you with as much information about your orthodontic and dental needs as possible. During this visit, you will have the opportunity to meet our team, learn more about orthodontics, receive a complete initial exam and find out which treatment options will best meet your needs.</p>
    <p>Upon arriving to our office you will be greeted by Stacy Jamison, our Practice Coordinator, who is always eager to assist. Stacy will help you check into the office so that on subsequent visits you can use our finger pad to sign in to your appointment. We pride ourselves on always running on time, so if you wait longer than 15 minutes past your scheduled appointment time, please let Stacy know! Feel free to help yourself to refreshments while you wait in our comfortable and relaxing reception area.</p>
    <p>At your complimentary initial examination Tammy Brown, our New Patient Coordinator, will obtain a full set of digital images as well as a panoramic and cephalometric digital x-rays. These initial images will help Dr. Periago provide you with an accurate initial diagnosis and treatment plan. After you begin treatment, Dr. Periago will study these images to devise a customized treatment plan for you or your child. At the time of the complete oral exam Dr. Periago will go over in detail all pertinent findings, and In most cases, she will let you know specifically what, if any, orthodontic treatment is needed. Dr. Periago believes in providing patients with as much information as possible in order to allow them to make an informed decision in selecting the treatment option that best suits them. Therefore, you will never feel rushed and you will have ample time to discuss any orthodontic treatment questions that you may have with Dr. Periago. After the exam and consultation, Tammy will discuss all scheduling information as well as financial information, insurance options and payment plans.</p>
    <p>Dr. Periago and the whole Periago Ortho team will be glad to answer any questions you may have, and we will provide all of the information that you need to determine which treatment is right for you. Please contact our practice to schedule your initial consultation.</p>

    <h4>What happens after the initial consultation?</h4>
    <p>After your complimentary consultation, you are one step closer to achieving the smile you’ve always wanted! Your next step is to schedule a records appointment, where we will take detailed impressions of your teeth. These impressions serve to purposes: one is to aid Dr. Periago in her final diagnosis and customized treatment plan, and the second is to serve as a model for construction of your individualized custom trays for bracket placement. At Periago Orthodontics we offer Indirect Bonding, which is a technique for faster and more accurate bracket placement, as well as increased patient comfort. This customized way of placing appliances decreases the overall time you or your child are in the dental chair for the actual placement of your brackets, as well as a more precise placement of the brackets resulting in overall faster treatment time!</p>
    <p>Following your records appointment, you will be scheduled no more than ten days later for placement of your brackets with your customized trays. At the beginning of the appointment Dr. Periago will review and discuss your customized treatment plan as well as confirm her initial diagnosis. If upon detailed study of the records, something was detected that was not discussed in the initial exam (need for extractions or additional appliances etc…) a change may be required in the initial treatment plan, and so a modification will be made to ensure the best course of treatment.</p>
    <p>The actual placement of the braces only takes about 30 to 45 minutes, but you will be scheduled for 90 minutes in order to provide ample time for detailed instruction on your new life with braces. Dr. Periago and her team will discuss every aspect of life with braces from oral hygiene to do’s and don’t’s; and will go above and beyond to teach you new techniques to help you with brushing and care of your braces. We will also let you know when your next follow up appointment should be scheduled. Our use of cutting edge technology allows patients to be seen at a 4 to 8 week intervals with an average adjustment appointment length of 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Scheduling Appointments</h4>
    <p>Visiting the orthodontist about every four to eight weeks is an important part of your orthodontic treatment. Our practice will work with you to make sure that your appointments are as convenient as possible. When scheduling appointments, please let us know what days and times work best for you.</p>
    <p>We understand that “life happens”! If you’re running late or need to reschedule, please let us know and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. When you’re ready to schedule your first appointment, contact our practice and Stacy or Tammy will be more than happy to assist you. We’re looking forward to working with you!</p>
