  <h4>Forsus™ Fatigue Resistant Device</h4>
  <p>Class II correction (correction of an overjet/”overbite”) can be challenging for all parties involved. Many class II bites can be corrected via removable elastics or rubber bands. Some overjet (“overbite”) corrections are so difficult that traditional elastics alone are not sufficient for full correction. When severity of correction and patient compliance is an issue, Dr. Periago recommends the Forsus appliance for bite correction.</p>

  <h4>Palatal Expanders</h4>
  <p>Palatal expanders are fixed appliances that expand/widen the roof of the mouth. Sometime’s a patient’s upper jaw needs to be enlarged for a proper fit with the lower jaw and a healthy, stable bite. In such cases, Dr. Periago may widen the upper jaw with an expander.</p>
  <p>Dr. Periago recommends two different types of expanders a Rapid Palatal Expander (RPE) or a Quad helix. The RPE requires adjustment at home whereas the quad helix is adjusted in the office. Dr. Periago will let you know which appliance is right for your child based on their growth and development. These devices spread the center of the palate into two halves thereby separating the upper jaw. New bone then fills in between the two halves and the upper jaw remains permanently wider. This procedure is very well tolerated by children and creates virtually no discomfort!</p>

  <h4>HOW LONG WILL EXPANSION WITH AN RPE TAKE?</h4>
  <p>This is determined by Dr Periago depending on your specific needs, but activation typically lasts several weeks. Once the activation period is complete, the expander MUST stay in place for 4-6 months. This allows new bone to form in the roof of your mouth which will insure that expansion will not relapse.</p>

  <h4>HOW WILL IT FEEL?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Some initial discomfort and “PRESSURE” may be felt: other times a tingling or itch under the expander may be experienced.</li>
    <li>A tingling sensation or pressure may occur on the bridge of your nose.</li>
    <li>You also might hear a “POP”; this is the suture separating and is completely normal.</li>
    <li>The first noticeable effect of the “RPE” is that the front teeth may begin to separate creating aspace between the front teeth. This is a sign that the appliance is working properly, do not panic! The space between your front teeth is temporary and will close naturally after the key turning is stopped.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>HOW TO ACTIVATE YOUR RPE:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Insert the key carefully into the hole or slot in the middle of the appliance.</li>
    <li>Push the key gently and steadily from the front toward the back of your mouth.</li>
    <li>Do not back the key up: remove the key back towards the throat. Make sure you can see the next hole come around to the front of the appliance for the next turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>T-REX APPLIANCE OR PENDEX DISTALIZER</h4>
  <p>This appliance is used to create space in the upper jaw when crowding is present preventing full eruption of the teeth. This appliance is also used to correct mild class II bites by moving the molars back in the mouth allowing the top molars to properly fit together with the bottom molars in an ideal relation. While design of this appliance is intended to counter forward movement of the teeth, patient compliance is very important to avoid unwanted effects such as flaring out of the upper incisors. Working together as a team with our patients is a must with this particular appliance.</p>

  <h4>Lower Lingual Arch</h4>
  <p>A lingual arch is an orthodontic device which connects two molars in the upper or lower dental arch. The lower lingual arch (LLA) has an archwire adapted to the lingual side of the lower teeth. In the upper arch the archwire is usually connected to the two molars passing through the palatal vault, and is commonly referred as “Transpalatal Arch” (TPA).</p>
  <p>Lingual arches are typically used for space maintenance or for prevention of space loss. They are used to stabilize permanent molar position and can also be used to stabilize molar position in the attempt to avoid side effects that can take place during orthodontic therapy. As a space maintainer lingual arches are frequently used in cases where an early loss of the second primary or “baby” molar takes place. In such a case a lingual arch prevents the permanent molars from moving forward thus blocking off the eruption space for the premolar teeth. The lower lingual arch is also used in order to maintain the “Leeway space”, which is the extra space available in the arch when the primary or “baby” molars are lost and replaced by smaller permanent premolars.</p>

  <h4>FACEMASK</h4>
  <p>One of the most pressing developmental problems of the mouth in children is a developing underbite. Underbites can be due to disharmony in the growth of the upper and lower jaws. Between the ages of 7-10, we have the ability to move the upper jaw forward in order to correct a deficient upper jaw. It is very important to do so at this time due to the fact that the upper jaw stops growing before the lower jaw. If the upper jaw remains behind the lower one, surgery may be required for full correction once the jaw growth is complete.</p>
  <p>The facemask appliance can be worn by children in order to promote upper jaw growth. It is well tolerated by children and is composed of two parts: A fixed piece that is cemented into the mouth and a removable face frame portion that is worn at home in the evening hours as well as while sleeping. Treatment time typically lasts 9-12 months.</p>
