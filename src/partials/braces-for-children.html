  <p>The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that at age 7 children should be evaluated by an orthodontist. This visit will provide parents with information regarding their child’s skeletal growth pattern, dental development, as well as the chance to advise parents on ideal treatment timing. In most cases the orthodontist will simply monitor the patient at a 6 to 12 month interval until the patient is either ready for treatment or it is determined that treatment is not needed. Usually by age 7 the first permanent molars and incisors have erupted sufficiently to allow the orthodontist to evaluate for crossbites, crowding, and skeletal problems. When treatment is begun early, the orthodontist can guide the growth of the jaw and guide incoming permanent teeth.</p>
