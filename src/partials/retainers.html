  <p>Once orthodontic treatment is completed it is necessary to maintain the teeth in their final position with retainers. There are several types of retainers that Dr. Periago recommends: the Hawley Retainer, the Essix Retainer and a Fixed Retainer. Dr. Periago will let you know which retainer she recommends for you or your child.
  <br>
  Retainer wear is extremely important to maintain a stable bite and smile for a lifetime; therefore Dr.Periago recommends indefinite wear of retainers. When braces are removed Dr. Periago will give detailed instructions on how much the retainers need to be worn. Typically retainers are worn full time except while eating and brushing for 8 weeks following the removal of the braces. At this point, Dr. Periago will decrease the amount of time retainers must be worn until night time only wear is appropriate.</p>

  <p>Basic Retainer Guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Store your retainer only in your retainer case…do not place them in your pocket because they can break!</li>
    <li>Do not wrap your retainers in napkins or place them on lunch trays…they almost always end up in the garbage!</li>
    <li>Keep retainers away from dogs and pets…they love to eat them!</li>
    <li>Clean your retainer every time you brush your teeth! Clean retainers with a separate tooth brush and antimicrobial soap. Retainer cleaners can be used no more than once every several months. Do not boil or place your retainers in the dishwasher as they will warp and no longer fit!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>PLEASE call us during regular business hours if you lose or break your retainer so that we can schedule an appointment for a replacement retainer. Remember your teeth can relapse quickly in the first few months after braces are removed so please do not forget to let us know! You’ve worked hard for your smile! Please wear your retainer to keep your smile beautiful and healthy for the rest of your life!</p>
